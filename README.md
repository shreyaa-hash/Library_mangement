Library Management System (Python Console-Based)

This is a terminal-based Library Management System built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming, pandas, numpy, and simulated IoT (RFID). It allows users to manage book records, search, issue, return, and recommend books with CSV integration and data analytics.

Features:
- Add new books (with duplicate ID check)
- View all books in a neat Pandas table
- Search books by keyword (title)
- Issue and Return books
- View real-time summary using NumPy (Issued %, etc.)
- Export and Import data from CSV
- Recommend books based on interest/topic
- Simulate RFID-based IoT book issuing
- Persistent data handling with file support

Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- pandas for tabular data handling
- numpy for analytics
- random and time for RFID simulation

Menu-Based System:
1. View All Books
2. Search Book
3. Issue Book
4. Return Book
5. Add Book
6. Summary
7. Export Library to CSV
8. Import Library from CSV
9. Recommend Books
10. Simulate IoT Book Issue
11. Exit

Example Output:
Library Summary:
   Total    Issued       Available        Issued %
     10          3                        7                    30.0

Requirements:
pip install pandas numpy
